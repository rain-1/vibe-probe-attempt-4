Last spring, I sat on the bank of the river watching a crane wade through the shallows, hunting for frogs. My cell buzzed in my pocket—a text from my brother asking if I'd watched the tennis match last night. I hadn't; I'd been too busy at the bank trying to sort out a loan for the new house. The loan officer's desk had a broken spring in the chair, and it squeaked every time she leaned forward to check her cell for messages.
The construction site next door had a massive crane lifting steel beams, and I remember thinking how strange it was that we use the same word for that machine and the elegant bird by the water. A bat swooped overhead as dusk fell—probably heading to the old barn where a whole colony of bats roost in the rafters. My son has a baseball bat signed by his favorite player; he keeps it on display and won't let anyone touch it, even though the grip has lost its spring and the wood is starting to crack.
I struck a match to light the campfire, but the first match was damp and wouldn't catch. The flames reminded me of a documentary about cell division I'd watched—how a single cell splits into two, over and over. My uncle spent three years in a prison cell for fraud; he said the worst part was the tiny window and the broken spring in his mattress. When he got out, the first thing he did was visit a natural spring in the mountains, filling bottles with cold water that didn't match the metallic taste of prison taps.
The curtains in my office don't match the carpet—my wife keeps reminding me. She works at a bank downtown, the same bank where we first met. There's a spring-fed pond behind her building where cranes gather in the spring, and sometimes she sends me photos from her cell. I keep telling her the pictures don't match the real thing; you have to see a crane take flight to understand how beautiful they are.
My daughter's science project is about bat echolocation—how bats navigate using sound. She built a model cell with a spring-loaded mechanism that demonstrates how cell membranes work. Her teacher said it was the best in the class, a perfect match of creativity and accuracy. We celebrated by going to the bank of the lake where we watched the sunset, and I taught her how to safely light a match for the first time.
The championship match is tomorrow, and the team has been practicing their bat swings all week. The coach says their timing doesn't match what it needs to be, so they've installed a machine that uses a spring to launch balls at different speeds. Meanwhile, a crane has been brought in to install new lights at the stadium—the old ones didn't match safety codes. I watched from across the bank of the creek that runs behind the field, where I spotted a crane standing perfectly still in the water.
My cell battery died just as I got the notification that our offer on the house was accepted by the bank. I had to borrow a match from a stranger to see my way back to the car in the dark. A bat flew past my head, startling me so badly I nearly dropped my son's bat that I'd been carrying from practice. Next spring, we'll be living in that house, drinking water from the natural spring in the backyard, watching cranes fly overhead, and maybe finally getting furniture that actually matches.
