Please can you create a visualizer for the probe, we should a data sample using the same warmup then low temp generation as the generate_data script (maybe hack it to be a function we can call?) and then please set up the probe to be attached to the LLM and attach to the correct site and read out its output value when applied to the hidden state of then LLM processing up to that token, for evey single token. Generate an HTML page which color codes the background of each token according to the probe output.
We will also be doing a scan of probes throughout the layers of the model, so we'd need a slider to scrub through those.
